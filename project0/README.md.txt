Here's my first stab at a website, I made it around my music since I'd like to make a beautiful website displaying my music once I've completed the course(or during)!

I have 4 HTML files, Each page has a navigation bar which I took most of the code from W3 schools, I also added another piece of code, (also from W3 schools) to shift the navigation bar to display the options vertically when on a mobile device.
Index.html is my home page. This page links to all my other pages, with an additional link to my music page with an alert message I grabbed from bootstrap.

music.html is the page where I linked all of my music on a single column table to display my music.

projects.html is where I plan to display all of the projects I work on here in this class and the others I plan to take after this course.

contact.html is a page where I plan to either add a form or just a way to contact me for any sort of inquires.




Thank you!
